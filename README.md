# Kick60K
A large-scale multi-modal dataset collected from Kickstarter

A Github Pages template for academic websites. This was forked (then detached) by [Stuart Geiger](https://github.com/staeiou) from the [Minimal Mistakes Jekyll Theme](https://mmistakes.github.io/minimal-mistakes/), which is © 2016 Michael Rose and released under the MIT License. See LICENSE.md.

I think I've got things running smoothly and fixed some major bugs, but feel free to file issues or make pull requests if you want to improve the generic template / theme.

### Note: Complete dataset are currently stored on Baidu Cloud Drive. If you need access to them, please feel free to contact the [author](mailto:zjzhang2023@hkbu.edu.hk.com). 
### Any request will be warmly welcomed and encouraged, as it is a contribution to the crowdfunding community.
